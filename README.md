**Explanation of filenames**  <br/>
_e.g. attack_z_train_and_test_noise_0.02_ang_0.2_no_2.npy_ <br/>

attack: attacked measurements <br/>
train_and_test: raw data of training and testing set <br/>
noise_0.02: the standard deviation of the measurement noise is 2% <br/>
ang_0.2: the strength of attacks is set as 0.2 <br/>
no_2: the number of attacked buses is set as 2 <br/>https://github.com/xjtuerr/xjtuerr.github.io/blob/main/README.md

Notably, the training set and testing set are selected from _xxx_train_and_test_xxx.npy_ by the imbalance and labeling ratios.
